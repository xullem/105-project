                <h4>Ask Questions!</h4>
                <p>Be brave enough to ask questions. This is a new skill you're learning and I guarentee that no one in the Skillcrush community will make you feel stupid .</p>
 
                <h4>Not knowing is part of the gig.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. Let it wash over you. It will make start to make sense in time.</p>

                <h4>Practice coding as often as you can</h4>
                <p>...and don't forget to have some fun while you're doing it!</p>
